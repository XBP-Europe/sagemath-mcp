# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We currently support the latest released version of the `sagemath-mcp` package. Security fixes will be applied to `main` and backported only when there is a compelling reason.

| Version | Supported |
| ------- | --------- |
| latest  | ✅        |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately to the maintainers:

- Email: sagemath-mcp-maintainers@proton.me

Please include:

1. A description of the issue and its impact.
2. Steps to reproduce or proof-of-concept code, if available.
3. Any relevant environment details (operating system, Sage version, configuration).

We aim to acknowledge reports within **3 business days** and provide an initial assessment within **7 business days**.

## Disclosure Policy

1. We will confirm the issue and determine its scope.
2. A fix will be developed and reviewed. When possible we will coordinate with you regarding timelines.
3. A security advisory will be published once a fix is available, and a new release will be tagged.
4. Credit will be given to reporters unless they prefer to remain anonymous.

## PGP / Encryption

If you prefer to encrypt your report, please request our PGP public key via email. We will respond with the key and next steps.

## Guidelines for Responsible Research

- Do not publicly disclose vulnerabilities before we have had a chance to remediate.
- Avoid accessing or modifying data without explicit permission.
- Never use automated scanning in ways that could impact service availability.

Thank you for helping keep SageMath MCP safe for everyone!
